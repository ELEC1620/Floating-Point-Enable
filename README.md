  Floating Point Enable
  =====================
  
  The ability to print floating point numbers and general floating point support within MBED OS 6 is
  automatically set to 'Minimal'. To allow full use of floating points, copy the mbed_app.json file
  into your project file tree. There is no need to use the syntax '#include' within your main.cpp file
  as the .json file will become engrained within the main body of the program during compilation.
